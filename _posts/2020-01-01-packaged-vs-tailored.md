While browsing the [catalogue](/catalogue.html), you'll see
that customizations are either **packaged** or **tailored**.

**Packaged** customizations are relatively independent of specific
business processes and provide useful functionality out of the box.

**Tailored** customizations are tightly coupled to specific processes,
names, terminology, numbering formats, etc. that are unlikely to
be the same across different production environments and are not 
easily catered for with configuration.

Prior to purchasing a tailored customization, we will work with
you to determine the changes required to fit your requirements, and 
provide a free proposal and quote following our 
[custom development process](/development.html).

Any customization, tailored or packaged, can be adjusted to meet
your specific requirements.  [Let us know](mailto:chris@poplars.dev)
if you'd like more information or if there is a customization we can adjust 
for you.
