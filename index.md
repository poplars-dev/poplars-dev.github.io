Welcome to Poplar Development! We provide 
[custom development and automation services](/development.html). 
Our focus is building [quality](/quality.html) customizations to 
[Sage 300](https://www.sage.com) using modern
software development techniques and best practices. 

We build using 
[Orchid Extender](https://www.orchid.systems/product/extender), 
the most flexible platform for the rapid development of Sage customizations.
Coupled with [Customization Manager](/customizations.html), higher 
[quality](/quality.html) customizations can be developed and distributed in
less time.  Browse the [Customization Catalogue](/catalogue.html) to see 
some of the customizations we have built.

In addition to customizations, we are responsible for the 
[Remote Actions](/remote-actions.html) Module and Fleeting Forms, 
which together power Orchid Systems's 
[Remote Action](https://www.orchid.systems/product/remote-action) product.

All of our work is built on the powerful open source libraries 
available for Python. Much of the code we develop and training we deliver are
[open source in kind](/opensource.html).
