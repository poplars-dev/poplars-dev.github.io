Welcome to Poplar Development! We provide 
[custom development and automation services](/development.html). 
Our focus is building quality customizations to 
[Sage 300](https://www.sage.com) using modern
software development techniques and best practices to make Sage work for you. 

We develop customizations using 
[Orchid Extender](https://www.orchid.systems/product/extender), 
the most flexible platform for the rapid development of Sage Customizations.
Coupled with [Customization Manager](/customizations.html), higher quality
customizations can be developed and distributed in less time through code
reuse.

In addition to bespoke customizations, we are responsible for the 
[Remote Actions](/remote-actions.html) Module and Fleeting Forms, 
which together power Orchid Systems's 
[Remote Action](https://www.orchid.systems/product/remote-action) product.

All of our work is built on the powerful open source libraries 
available for Python.  Much of the code we develop and training we deliver are
[open source in kind](/opensource.html).
