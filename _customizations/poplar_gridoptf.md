A simple customization that adds an optional field to a grid.  The field can be
made either read-only or read-write.  All changes to the grid are immediately
applied to the optional field.  

If the optional field has a validation list, a finder is provided in the grid
and only valid values are allowed.

The {{ page.name }} customization needs to be tailored to display the correct
optional field in the correct location.
