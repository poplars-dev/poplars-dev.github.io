Add the full IET audit trail to shipment optional fields for integration with 
an external CRM.
<!--more-->

This customization sets optional fields on O/E Shipments that include the full
P/O and O/E audit trails for inter-entity transactions.  This can be used
for integrations with external systems that need the audit trail without 
parsing the IET logs.
