## How does it work?

The Order Number Column for A/P Invoice Entry customization is an example
of adding an editable column to a grid to display and manage an optional
field.  

When the screen starts up, the customization adds a new column to the grid
and populates it with the value from the optional field.  As the field is
updated and changed, the optional field is kept in sync in the background.
