The Address Validation customization interfaces with providers APIs,
including USPS, Canada Post, and Google, to validate addresses not only
for correctness but also deliverability.
<!--more-->

## Business Case

Incorrect addresses can be costly:

- Address correction charges
- Failed deliveries and re-sends
- Time spent correcting

The Address Validation customization checks addresses not only for validity but
also deliverability when orders or other documents are posted, reducing costs
and administrative overhead.

## How does it work?

The customization uses open source Python libraries to connect to the an
address provider API and validates the addresses before objects are inserted or
updated.  

The validation is performed by a script that can be connected to any view with
a complete set of address fields.  If the provider API cannot be contacted a
warning is issued to prompt the user to verify the address manually.

## Features

Uses APIs to validate addresses in real time:

- Postal Code lookup
- Postal Code correction
- Route Type correction
- Street Number Validity for Street
- Mismatched Province/State/City

### Providers

The following address data providers are supported:

| Provider    | Country | Cost               |
|-------------|---------|--------------------|
| USPS        | US      | Free               |
| Google      | Intl.   | ~0.0015/lookup     |
| Canada Post | CA      | 0.05 - 0.10/lookup |

Notes:
- Google provides only validity, not deliverability, validation.
- All providers require registration and that users manage their own accounts.
