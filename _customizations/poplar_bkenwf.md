Workflow to force approval for posting Bank Entries in the Sage 300 Bank
Services module.
<!--more-->

## How does it work?
Each Bank entry gets submitted for approval through Extenderâ€™s
workflow engine. Approver or Approvers are notified by email that
an entry has been submitted and requires approval.  Approver(s) can review and
approve/reject the entry from their Extender Workflow Console.

If approved, Bank Entry is automatically posted to Bank Services.
If rejected, Bank Entry is available to be updated and re-submitted to the
workflow for approval.

Also included is a custom workflow action to allow approver(s) to approve and
post multiple entries with one click. One entry is highlighted in the workflow
console. Approver(s) select the **Approve All** button, which
posts all entries that were submitted by the same user and on the same date as
the highlighted entry.

The following components are included:

- Bank Entry Approval Workflow Template
- Script to prevent users from updating Bank Entry that has been submitted for
  approval
- Relevant Email Message Templates
- Custom workflow action to approve multiple entries

**NOTE**

We recommend removing the "Post" button from Bank Entry using Sage
User Authorizations to ensure Bank Entries can only be posted through the
workflow.
