Create custom Purchase Orders from Sales Orders.
<!--more-->

This customization provides a custom process for creating Purchase Orders
from O/E Orders. It automatically changes UOMs, conslidates, sets up drop
shipping, and generates an Excel file that can be shared with the supplier
automatically.

The customization is easily tailored to provide custom SO selection (i.e.
non-sequential orders), support for drop-shipping, UOM conversion, and more.
