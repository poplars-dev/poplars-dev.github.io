grid in the A/R Customer Inquiry Adjustments tab that displays the adjustment
Reference.

## How does it work?

The customization adjusts the A/R Customer Inquiry screen to add a new field to
the grid, making it quick and easy to identify the reference for a particular 
adjustment.

More generally, this customization adds a column to a grid. Columns with 
read-only or read-write data can put the information required
at hand and can be added to almost any grid in Sage.
