The fleeting forms webservice provides a rich form generation API.
It is used to programatically create forms and collect their results.  Fleeting
forms are used to extend validated data collection for legacy applications to 
the cloud and enable access from beyond the firewall.

The Fleeting Forms webservice is deployed in AWS to support 
[fleetingforms.io](https://fleetingforms.io).
