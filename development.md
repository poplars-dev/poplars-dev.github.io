## Custom Development

Sage 300 is a complex ERP that has evolved over many decades.  As its 
capabilities have expanded, through native development or acquisition, so
too have the complexities of its internals.  Add to the mix a large array
of third party extensions and the resulting environment can provide unique
challenges to the introduction of new customizations.

Through the delivery of over 50 Extender Customizations, we have learned that 
even the simplest requests can be complicated by the local configuration,
third party integrations, or unexpected limitations in Sage.

Our custom development service builds on this experience by dilligently working
through a process mitigates these risks and helps to deliver a quality result. 
All custom development engagements go through the following steps:

1. Custom Development Request
1. Site Readiness Assessment
1. Custom Development Proposal
1. Customization Development
1. Testing with Representative Data
1. Production Implementation

### Custom Development Request

Requesting a new customization is easy: 
<a href="mailto:chris@poplars.dev?Subject=Customization Request">send us an 
email</a> with a description of the problem you're trying to solve or the 
workflow that needs automating and we will start working out the details!

### Site Readiness Assessment

The Site Readiness Assessment is performed online.  You'll 
complete a survey that helps us to qualify the customer's Sage 300 environment
for Extender and the customization.

### Custom Development Proposal

The proposal includes a description of the request, a high level technical
design for the solution, and a set of Acceptance Tests that are used to verify 
the successful completion of the project in the customer environment.

Once the scope of the project defined in the proposal has been agreed upon, it
will be used as the basis for a custom quote.

### Customization Development

Once the quote has been accepted and the deposit placed, development work will
begin.  All customizations are developed using 
[extools](/opensource.html#extools) and distributed using 
[Customization Manager](/customizations.html).

### Testing

All development is done using the `SAMINC` database that is distributed with the
current version of Sage 300.  Once the development has been completed with the 
sample data, the customization must be tested in an environment representative
of the customer environment before deployment in production.

Testing is conducted by an Implementation Specialist using a Test database that
contains data that is representative of the production environment. 

It is the responsibility of the Business Partner or Client to provide either:

- remote access to a representative test environment, or
- a copy of representative test data and copies of any third party products or
  customizations already in place.

Testing of the installation procedure, the customization logic, and usability
are then conducted in the representative environment.

### Production Implementation

The implementation of the customization in production must be done by an
Implementation Specialist.
