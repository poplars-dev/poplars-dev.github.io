title: Why Customize Sage with Extender and Python?
tags: extender python
---

There are different approaches to developing customizations for Sage 300.
Using VBA or C#, the Sage 300 SDK can be used to develop compiled 
customizations to add business logic or screen changes.  This is the approach
used by most third party component and application developers.

Building using the SDK provides developers with full flexibility and access
to all the facilities within Sage 300.  This comes at the expense of having
to recompile, and potentially update, customizations for every new version
of Sage 300.

[Orchid Extender](https://orchid.systems/product/extender) is an extension
to Sage implemented using the SDK.  It provides an abstraction layer that 
allows developers to write extensions and customizations for Sage in using
Python. Python is an interpreted language, code isn't compiled until runtime.
This enables the development of customizations that do not require 
recompilation or changes when Sage is upgraded.

Python is a popular, high-level, programming language.  As a high-level
language, it allows developers to focus on implementing business logic, while
looking after the low level tasks required for all programming.

## Dynamic

As an interpreted, high-level, programming languauge, Python allows developers
to focus on on implementing business logic, doesn't require recompilation on
each change, and looks after low level tasks like memory allocation and type
management.

## Widespread

Python has found diverse applications in web development, high performance
computing, science, stats and modelling. It has been used to develop websites 
like 
[Instagram](https://instagram-engineering.com/web-service-efficiency-at-instagram-with-python-4976d078e366), 
[Netflix](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/python-at-netflix-86b6028b3b3e),
[Dropbox](https://www.pythonpeople.nl/how-python-powers-dropbox/), 
and many others.  

Python is widepsread and so are the people using it! It is supported by a 
vibrant community and there is lots of help and expertise available online.

This is borne out by the 
[State of the Octoverse](https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages), which 
aggregates statistics on the programming languages used in the many projects 
on github.com.  Python consistently represents between 14% and 18% of all
projects and is growing much more rapidly than C# or VB.NET, which together
account for less than 4%.

There is a broad talent pool of Python developers out there that are capable
of maintaining customizations written in Python. Coupled with the 
accessibility of the language, this makes 
customizations written in Python more maintainable over time.
